Jeroen's Free Pascal Units
==========================
These are units that I wrote to make my work in Pascal a bit easier. You may use them if you think they are useful under the terms of the zlib license.
Please note:
- Pascal is no longer my prime language (it used to be in the DOS era) due to my focus now lying on C++ when it comes to my core programming. Expect very little updates here.
- I wrote these for Free Pascal, although Free Pascal opts to be compatible with Delphi, I really don't know if anything in this repository will work in Delphi. You are free to try, but I cannot give any guarantees.
- These units are definitely not set up to be used in old versions of Turbo Pascal (unless explicitly states otherwise in the comments of that file itself), so don't even try.
